Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work? 
We have a set schedule and clear delegation of daily tasks. Stand-up meetings followed by close of day meetings to manage workflow and progress/issues.

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Begin with 1:1 communication between the 2 parties who are having conflict.
If the issue persists: As a group we will come together to help workout the issue as a collective and remind everyone we are here as a cohesive unit to work together, not be at odds..
If group resolve fails: We will request outside mediation from an instructor, this will either be help as a group or between the two conflicting parties and an instructure; dependent upon comfort level of the parties and the issue. 






What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? 
Have a mention of it at stand up in the am and if possible have the steamroller take on the role of navigator in pair programming that day.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? 
Pair programming to catch up and educate disparate skill levels.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Publicly after privately. If problem persists, then with the instructors
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 
When private addressing and public addressing does not solve the issue to group unanimous satisfaction.

9am pst to 6pm pst and later as needed. Communication can be guaranteed until 6pm and after as needed.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? 
Stand-up meeting will be democratic: led by a different member every day.
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
Support one another and have an agreement in place from day one emphasizing the value of team members input in any capacity.
